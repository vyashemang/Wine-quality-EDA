Understanding the wine data columns

The data-set is related to white variants of wine

1)   __fixed acidity__  :  most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily)

2)  __volatile acidity___ : the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste
   
3)   __citric acid__ : found in small quantities, citric acid can add ‘freshness’ and flavor to wines
    
4)   __residual sugar__ : the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it’s rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet
    
5)   __chlorides__ :  the amount of salt in the wine
    
6)   __free sulfur dioxide__ : the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisul-fite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine
   
7)   __total sulfur dioxide__ : amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine
   
8)   __density__ : the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar con-tent

9)   __pH__ : describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3–4 on the pH scale
    
10)   __sulphates__ : a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, which acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant
   
11)   __alcohol__ : the percent alcohol content of the wine
   
12)   __quality__ : output variable (based on sensory data, score between 0 and 10)
